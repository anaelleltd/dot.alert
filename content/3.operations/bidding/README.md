# Bidding

Bidding operations are fairly limited in scope within the Polkadot ecosystem. Users can place bids for very specific purposes such as:

* a [membership](kappa-sigma-mu-ksm-membership.md) on _Kappa Sigma Mu_ Society (Kusama)
* a [parachain slot lease](parachain-slot-lease.md) during Parachain auctions (Kusama and Polkadot)
