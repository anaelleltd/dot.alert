# Bidding

Bidding operations are fairly limited in scope within the Polkadot ecosystem. Currently, there are only a couple of platforms on which users can place bids for very specific purposes such as:

* a [membership](kappa-sigma-mu-ksm-membership.md) on _Kappa Sigma Mu_ Society (Kusama)
* a [parachain slot lease](parachain-slot-lease.md) during Parachain auctions (Kusama and Polkadot)
* an NFT on [_RMRK_ 2.1](https://www.rmrk.app/) (Kusama) \[TBC]
* a network-backed security on [_Gilts_](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama-rpc.dwellir.com#/gilt) (Kusama) \[TBC]
