# Lending

Lending tokens is an essential feature of Decentralised exchanges (DEXes) and a core aspect of Decentralised Finance (DeFi) operations. By depositing their assets in [liquidity pools](liquidity-provision.md), users endorse the functionalities of protocols and are rewarded in return.

In the Polkadot ecosystem, the circulation of capital across DeFi-specific parachains creates a competitive environment in which platforms offer refined [financial instruments](derivatives-markets.md) to attract and retain lenders for the long term.
