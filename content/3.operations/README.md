# 3.Operations

Being the custodian of your assets allows you to access a wide range of protocols and **web3 services**.&#x20;

Depending on your interests, you will be able to:

* enrol in [collectives](bidding/kappa-sigma-mu-ksm-membership.md)
* participate in [decision-making](voting/)
* obtain [funding](crowdfunding/)
* contribute to [network security](staking/)
* [swap](swapping/), [borrow](borrowing/), and lend assets
* use NFT marketplaces
* capitalise on surveys

Nevertheless, operating on blockchain by your own means requires you to pay close attention to the underlying rules of the platforms that you use. This is because for each use case (ex: Governance, DeFi, Staking, etc.) there are multiple implementations (ex: forums, pools, rewards, etc.) available to users.&#x20;



**In this section, we look at how to optimise your interactions with various Polkadot  network protocols and avoid signing your assets away.**
