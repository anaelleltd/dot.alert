# Voting

Voting is the democratic power given to all token holders in the Polkadot ecosystem. Principally, partaking in on-chain governance means using your tokens to vote for or against proposed changes to current network operations.&#x20;

Every token holder has the liberty to:&#x20;

* endorse referendum proposal
* vote directly for referenda
* delegate their voting power to someone else
