# Voting

Voting is the democratic power given to all token holders in the Polkadot ecosystem. Principally, partaking in on-chain governance means using your tokens to vote for or against proposed changes to current network operations.&#x20;

Every token holder has the liberty to:&#x20;

* endorse referendum proposal
* [vote directly](direct-democracy.md) for referenda
* [delegate their voting power](democracy-delegation.md) to someone else
