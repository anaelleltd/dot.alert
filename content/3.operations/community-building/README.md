# Community Building

Community building is the sum of all off-chain operations and on-chain transactions that contribute to the creation and the maintenance of social media spaces dedicated to a project.

In the Polkadot ecosystem, self-directed crypto communities take inspiration from the DAO model to [onboard new contributors](crypto-communities.md) and [retain active participants](crypto-payments.md).
