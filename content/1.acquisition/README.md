You will need a Polkadot account to receive your coins/tokens, along with some understanding of the following concepts:

* Depending on the coins/tokens that you receive, you might need to pay attention to [existential deposits](existential-deposits.md).
* Depending on the dapps that you use, you might need to investigate [address formats](address-formats.md).
* Depending on the methods that you choose, you might need to make use of [transaction explorers](transaction-explorers.md).
