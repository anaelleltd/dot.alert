# 4.Social support

With so much innovation happening in the Polkadot ecosystem, you will need to find a way to keep up with the latest tech developments. An update can make a big difference in how people manage their assets, so users often **source information** in the following ways:

* directly from project team members (Founders, Community managers, Ambassadors)
* indirectly from projects publications (Docs, GitHub repos, Polkassembly posts, blogs)
* from official social media (Discord, Twitter, Telegram, Subsocial)
* from unofficial threads and tags (Reddit, Youtube)

Decentralised networks are made of communities that are not always visible or vocal, and this gives a lot of room for bad actors to run their schemes at the expenses of new or confused users.



**In this section, we present how to troubleshoot Polkadot-related issues and how to handle security settings when discussing and reviewing assets on social networks.**
