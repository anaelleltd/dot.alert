# Our mission

**The DotSama ecosystem is fundamentally complex.**&#x20;

_Relay chains, Parachains, Crowdloans and Cross-chain transactions_ are technologies that require users to juggle a lot of new concepts in real time.

With this alluring novelty come a lot of unwanted risks: errors when transferring funds, incompatibility between account types, limited integration of cold storage devices, hacks on experimental trading protocols, phishing on community forums, lack of clarity around legal obligations, etc.

**Dot.alert()** brings forth insights and must-have resources to guide DotSama users throughout their journey.
