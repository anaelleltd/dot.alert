## [Farmers Market: Censorship Resistance](https://twitter.com/erableofficial/status/1701895104594682307)

_15th September 2023 | A report by Onyinye M._

**Host: DAOChemist**

**Co-hosts: LandX and Kmens**&#x20;



Censorship resistance is an important aspect of DeFi, as it guarantees the freedom to transact for users and the integrity of transactions for blockchain networks. To expand on this important topic, the "Farmers market" livecast staged an interactive 2-hour session with prominent guests _Angle Protocol, Defi Africa, PWN, Polytope Labs,_ _Erable_ and _Adriano Feria_. The discussion focused on censorship resistance within the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) industry and its impact on the adoption of cryptocurrencies.&#x20;

Today, we report on the observations made throughout this conversation, from the significance of censorship resistance to its associated challenges, explaining the role that both individuals and governments play in practice.



### Understanding Censorship Resistance

In the context of blockchain technologies, censorship resistance relies on three major principles: Freedom to transact, Freedom from confiscation, and Immutability of transactions.&#x20;

**1. Freedom to Transact:**

The ultimate goal of censorship resistance is to shield users from undue control and give them the ability to access, transmit, and execute transactions without interference from external entities.&#x20;

#### **2. Freedom from confiscation:**

This positions censorship resistance as a safeguard against oppression, by ensuring that users' assets cannot be obtained by third-party entities at will.

#### **3. Immutability of transactions:**

Censorship resistance exists whenever there is evidence that no single entity can reverse a transaction, blacklist a wallet or address, or manipulate transactions for personal gains.

### **Achieving Censorship Resistance**

In practice, censorship manifests itself under two primary forms:&#x20;

* On-chain censorship which takes place at the networking layer and involves blockchain participants and stakeholders.
* Off-Chain / Social censorship which pertains to human interactions between the crypto ecosystem and the broader society and can be translated into governments/centralized authorities' interference.

Resisting on-chain censorship can be achieved through node decentralisation, Smart contracts security, and active engagement within governance. Diversifying interoperability protocols and implementing privacy-preserving solutions can also contribute to more censorship resistant networks.&#x20;

At the social layer, censorship resistance begins in the minds of the individuals: ‘_The people have to be stronger than the entities_’. It is important to establish grassroots educational initiatives for every protocol that aim to empower users with the knowledge and the awareness that they need to assert their rights.

### Practical Challenges to Censorship Resistance

Large corporations often lack plans to mitigate the risk of censorship, and this makes them vulnerable to government pressure. At the same time, censorship resistance is meant to be a built-in system for pushing back against encroachment by strong entities, but if users rely heavily on these monopolies, then resisting becomes difficult.

There are also constraints to censorship resistance for both Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work networks. Depending on their geographical locations, some startups can experience heavy crypto bans that freeze their projects and users can be flagged by banks for their fiat on-ramp transactions. For mining consortia, it is not always possible to run and maintain operations in certain cities. Building mining facilities and transporting mining rigs require access to natural resources and infrastructure that are controlled by local authorities.



Censorship resistance is critical for the crypto space, because it represents both a concept and a tool needed to preserve freedom and prevent stifling. And so, DeFi builders and users looking to make the most of new digital finance opportunities should pro-actively care about censorship resistance, not just show concern when one is directly affected.&#x20;

## [FEST IRL Onchain Exposition](https://twitter.com/optimismFND/status/1689309343852761089)

_17th August 2023 | A report by Onyinye M._

**Host: Optimism Foundation**

**Co-hosts: Friends With Benefits and binji**



Real-life events in the crypto industry offer a holistic view of blockchain, extending beyond DeFi or NFTs and enabling meaningful connections between individuals across various sectors. _Optimism_ recently hosted an enlightening session during which they dived into the successful FEST event and discussed on-chain culture, L2 NFTs, and the fusion of on-chain with real life.&#x20;

This report highlights the role of Optimism in supporting Public Goods and the pivotal insights noted on creating an all-inclusive, educational, and fun event.



### The Fusion of On-chain with Real-life

Optimism's involvement with FEST stems from its commitment to building an economy for people and recognising projects making a positive impact to the Optimism collective. The RetroPGF rewards Public Goods projects of all kinds as well as individuals such as artists and educators through retroactive funding. It acts as an enabler for contributors' ideas to come to life and create value.

### **On-Chain Community-Building**

The importance of on-chain community-building cannot be overstated. In the crypto industry, having solid online communities enhances real-life events, and prior familiarisation between community members helps foster deeper connections.&#x20;

While developers and tech developments facilitate onboarding, the true growth of a project stems from community engagement. And since on-chain actions can influence real-life engagement, having a strong digital presence is critical.&#x20;

### **Inclusivity and Balance**

Creating an all-inclusive atmosphere means that everyone in the community should feel relevant, from the crypto-curious novices to the seasoned experts. Behind NFT pfps, there are real people who want to be seen, heard, and who want to connect. IRL events would also benefit from being structured in a way that facilitates involvement in practice.&#x20;

Generally, events that cater to a wide range of audiences rather than targeting specific niches will add value to the collective. But it is also recommended to strike a balance between networking, education, and relaxation, which makes events both enriching and enjoyable. Blockchain-related initiatives don't have to be geared towards on-chain value creation: some could also aim for connection and fun - just like FEST!

### **Prioritising Cultural Integration and Affinity**&#x20;

Researching the significance of a location before hosting an event can help find unique ways to merge the distinct culture of crypto with the local culture. This is also a factor for success because maintaining authenticity adds resonance.

Bigger doesn't always mean better. Organising IRL events should focus on quality and not quantity. In fact, having a small number of participants can bring a sense of togetherness to an event and promote connecting on a personal level for attendees.&#x20;



Conducting successful IRL events depends on the vitality of the on-chain community. There is no doubt that high-profile speakers and projects can contribute greatly to the success of an event and that intentional collaboration remains an important piece of community-building. However, adopting an all-inclusive approach and maintaining authenticity stand as guiding principles for building thriving crypto-based communities in the real world.&#x20;

## [Measuring Impact of Grant Funding](https://twitter.com/grantsstack/status/1679203929526259712)

_14th July 2023 | A report by Onyinye M._

**Host: Gitcoin Grants Stack**

**Co-hosts: Hypercerts and Gitcoinreviews**



In the realm of cryptocurrency funding, the importance of measuring impact cannot be overstated. Impact measurement provides valuable data to substantiate the relevance and effectiveness of crypto funding initiatives, such as the Gitcoin Grants Programme. This data is crucial in demonstrating why web3 funding surpasses traditional methods. Various methodologies can be employed to gauge impact, ranging from the conventional approach of evaluating project proposals to a retrospective analysis of actual performance.&#x20;

This article delves into the significance of impact measurement and highlights the potential of decentralized standards, while addressing questions raised during an interactive space hosted by _Gitcoin_.



### The Importance of Impact Measurement

Impact measurement serves as a means to validate the value of crypto funding. By assessing the outcomes and accomplishments of funded projects, impact measurement offers tangible evidence of the positive change enabled by crypto grants. This empirical data aids in substantiating the superiority of web3 funding over traditional models, encouraging broader adoption and support.

### Approaches to Impact Measurement

#### **1. Traditional Method:**&#x20;

The traditional approach involves evaluating projects based on their stated objectives and proposed scope of work. By comparing the actual outcomes with the initial expectations, impact can be assessed. However, this method may fall short in the crypto space, as it is a fast-evolving space where projects may not always strictly adhere to their original plans and market conditions can cause rapid changes.

#### **2. Retrospective Approach:**&#x20;

In the crypto realm, a retrospective approach is more suitable for impact measurement. This approach entails reviewing a project's past performance and evaluating its actual achievements. Rather than relying solely on promises, this method analyses what has been accomplished, enabling a more accurate assessment of impact.

### Monetising Impact and Performance Metrics

Beyond securing funding, funded projects can also monetize their impact. Instead of solely relying on continuous funding, projects can leverage their demonstrated impact to attract more investments. Investors are increasingly interested in supporting projects with tangible and visible impact, allowing projects to sustain themselves and reduce their reliance on continuous grants.

### Decentralized Measurement Standards

One of the challenges with quadratic funding is the potential for it to become a popularity contest. The discussion highlighted the importance of decentralized measurement standards. Implementing a decentralized system for measuring impact would enhance transparency, trust, and credibility, ensuring fair evaluation of projects and a fair chance for projects to attract funding. By establishing a neutral and widely accepted standard, the decentralized approach would foster a more accurate assessment of projects' impact.

### **Questions and Answers**

During the discussion, several questions were posed to the host regarding Gitcoin's funding system and impact measurement. Here are some responses provided:

_**1. Are there any stats on grantees reapplying for Gitcoin grants over time?**_

Yes, Gitcoin does have statistics on grantees reapplying for grants. However, Gitcoin is actively working on making these external resources available to the public to enhance transparency. The host of the discussion committed to following up on this question to provide more detailed information.

_**2. How can we keep track of the history of projects, considering some use a unique address for each round?**_

While some projects may use unique addresses for each funding round, it is possible to monitor their activities by tracking their social media presence, websites, and other online platforms. These channels can provide insights into the project's progress and activities, even if they use different addresses for identification purposes.

**3. Does participating in successive rounds help projects drive engagements beyond one-time donations?**

Yes, participating in successive funding rounds can indeed help projects drive ongoing engagement beyond one-time donations. However, projects are encouraged to explore more sustainable avenues beyond repetitive participation



Impact measurement is important for both funding platforms like Gitcoin and funded projects. It helps platforms examine the value they are providing while assisting funded projects in realising and monetising their impact. Decentralised measurement standards on the other hand further contributes to the credibility and sustainability of crypto-funded projects.
