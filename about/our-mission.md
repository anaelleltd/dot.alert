# Our mission

**The Polkadot ecosystem is fundamentally complex.**&#x20;

_Relay chains, Parachains, Crowdloans and Cross-chain transactions_ are technologies that require users to juggle a lot of new concepts in real-time.

With this alluring novelty come a lot of unwanted risks: errors when transferring funds, incompatibility between account types, limited integration of cold wallets, bugs on experimental protocols, phishing on community forums, lack of clarity around legal obligations, etc.

****[**Dot.alert()**](../) **** brings forth insights and must-have resources to guide Polkadot users throughout their journey.
